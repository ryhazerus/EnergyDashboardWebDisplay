## Introduction

`P1 Energy Dashboard` is a self-hosted webapp for displaying information of a P1 smart meter. Currently the system is in development and only supports the `HomeWizard P1 Smart Meter`.
The easiest way to get started with the project is to clone or download this repository and run the docker compose file, but before you start make sure you have the prerequisites installed on your deployment environment.

The web-app is easy to use and provides a setup screen once deployed to be able to configure the connection to your local P1 meter.

### Prerequisites

Check out the following steps before running the system.

- NodeJS & NPM
- Docker

## Description

This is a self-hosted web-ui for running an energy dashboard for your smart meter. View total electricity usage, gas usage and water usage for different P1 smart meters. Currently we support the following meters but sign-up and stay up-to-date for when we release support for more meters.
