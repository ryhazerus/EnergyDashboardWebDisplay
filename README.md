# Energy Display for Web

A self-hosted webapp for displaying information of a P1 smart meter. Currently the system is in development and only supports the `HomeWizard P1 Smart Meter`. **NOTE:** Currently this whole system is purely an empty UI shell there is no connectivity with a backend server or smart meter yet.

## Description

This is a self-hosted web-ui for running an energy dashboard for your smart meter. View total electricity usage, gas usage and water usage for different P1 smart meters. Currently we support the following meters but sign-up and stay up-to-date for when we release support for more meters.

### Roadmap

- [ ] Support Static Meters for Energy, Water and Gas Usage
- [ ] Add local db for graphing information
- [ ] Add Configurable Meters for users
- [ ] Support other smart meters

## Screens

You can view a sample of the current screens below, a link to a demo page will be setup later as a demo.

**Setup**

Once finished, you can configure your Energy Display in your browser by settings its IP and choosing your meter (there is a plan to support more smart meters) and saving your settings.
